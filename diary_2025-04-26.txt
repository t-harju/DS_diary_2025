We are learning how to use GitHub and create repositories.

Now we are creating a text only file. 

I am using Notepad but Microsoft Word can also be used, as long as the file is saved as text only.

Visual Studio Code is also a good option to edit text.

With plain text file formatting (such as bold, italics) should not be used.
